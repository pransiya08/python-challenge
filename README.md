#python-challenge

this includes 2 python scripts which analyses the following:

  1 the financial records of a company by calculating the:
  
    > total months and total amount of the profit/loss
    > the changes in the monthly profit/loss and the average change over a certain period of time
    > this code also identifies the most significant profit and loss of the given financial data
  
  2 the poll data of a small-town election by identifying the:
  
    > total number of vote casts
    > the list of candidates who received votes
    > the total number of votes and vote% each candidate received
    > winner of the election
    
the results of both analysis are printed in separate text files
